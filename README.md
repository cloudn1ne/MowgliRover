# MowgliRover (legcy)

This repo holds the Mowgli/OM files that need to be deployed onto your Raspi.

The various pieces assume that your build matches https://github.com/cloudn1ne/Mowgli/ 

If your build deviates (different IMU, IMU connected to Raspi, etc ..) you will need to adapt the files in this repo.

To get started follow the instructions in [here](help/InstallMowgli.md)
